# Feature: System Specification Integration

**Feature ID**: 002
**Branch**: 002-system-specification-integration
**Status**: Specification Phase
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: Low (1-2 days)

## Overview

Integrate the comprehensive FBC Library Management System specification into the spec-kit development workflow. This ensures all system requirements, roles, permissions, and technical specifications are properly documented and tracked within the structured development process.

## Background

The FBC Library Management System has a detailed system specification document that outlines the complete architecture, roles, permissions, and operational requirements. This specification needs to be integrated into the spec-kit workflow to ensure:

- All development work aligns with system requirements
- Role-based permissions are properly enforced
- Technical specifications are accessible during development
- System behavior is consistently implemented across all features

## Goals

- Migrate existing system specification into spec-kit format
- Ensure all system requirements are properly documented
- Create reference documentation for development team
- Establish baseline for all future feature development

## User Stories

### As a Developer

- I want to access complete system specifications during development
- I want to understand role-based permissions and restrictions
- I want to reference technical requirements for new features
- I want to ensure my code aligns with system architecture

### As a System Administrator

- I want to understand the complete system capabilities
- I want to know user roles and their permissions
- I want to reference operational procedures

## Detailed System Specification

### 1. Purpose

Provide a complete, role-based library management system for FBC with secure authentication, book circulation, fines, subscriptions, and admin/staff dashboards. The system enforces strict permissions by user type and supports both physical and e-book flows.

### 2. Roles and Permissions

- **Admin**
  - Full CRUD on all users
  - Manage system settings, reports, books, fines, payments
  - Access all dashboards and views

- **Staff**
  - Shares manage-users UI with Admin but restricted actions
  - Can add/edit/delete only Student and Lecturer users
  - Can view Admin and Staff users but cannot edit/delete them
  - Manage books and fines

- **Lecturer**
  - Same dashboard/view as Student
  - Cannot subscribe (not required for premium features)

- **Student**
  - Access student dashboard
  - Requires active subscription for premium features (e.g., e-books)

**Server-side enforcement (fbc_users):**

- `can_add_user_type`: staff → student/lecturer only
- `can_edit_user`: staff → student/lecturer; self-edit permitted
- `can_delete_user`: staff → student/lecturer only
- `@active_subscription_required`: grants staff/lecturer/admin access, students need active subscription

### 3. Apps and Responsibilities

- **fbc_users**: custom user model, authentication, dashboards, system settings
- **fbc_books**: catalog, borrow/return flows, root URLs and admin dashboard
- **fbc_fines**: overdue detection, fine creation, status tracking
- **fbc_payments**: subscription/payment processing
- **fbc_notifications**: in-app notifications

### 4. Authentication and Security

- **CustomUser** extends Django user with:
  - `user_type`, `university_id`, `is_suspended`, `subscription_end_date`

- **Decorators:**
  - `database_verified_login_required` — verifies live DB presence and active/suspended state
  - `user_type_required([...])`, `admin_required`, `staff_or_admin_required`
  - `active_subscription_required` — bypass for staff/lecturers/admin; students must subscribe

- **Logout**: always shows a single success message (duplicates cleared)
- **Message clearing** on login preserves logout notice and avoids cross-view bleed-through

### 5. Key Views and URLs (fbc_users)

- `/users/login/` — login
- `/users/logout/` — logout
- `/users/dashboard/` — role-based dashboard redirect
- `/users/student-dashboard/`, `/lecturer-dashboard/`, `/staff-dashboard[-beautiful]/`, `/admin-dashboard/`
- `/users/manage-users/` — list/view (admin + staff)
- `/users/manage-users/add/` — add member (admin + staff with restrictions)
- `/users/manage-users/edit/<id>/` — edit member (admin + staff with restrictions; password changes via `set_password` + session preservation if self)
- `/users/manage-users/delete/<id>/` — delete member (admin; staff only for student/lecturer)
- `/users/manage-users/details/<id>/` — member details
- `/users/system-settings/` — admin-only system settings

### 6. Data Model (high-level)

- **User (CustomUser)**
  - user_type: `student|lecturer|staff|admin`
  - university_id, phone_number, profile_image
  - is_suspended, is_active, subscription_end_date, last_activity

- **Book**
  - metadata, status `available|borrowed`, relations to borrowing records

- **BookBorrowing**
  - user, book, borrowed_date, due_date, returned_date, status `active|returned`
  - computes overdue and fine generation on return

- **Fine**
  - user, book (nullable), amount, status `pending|paid`, date_issued

- **Payment**
  - user, amount, status `pending|completed`, created_at

- **LibraryNotification**
  - recipient, notification_type, created_at, content

### 7. Frontend

- Tailwind CSS with custom FBC color palette
- Admin themed templates: `templates/admin/admin_base.html`
- Public/base templates: `templates/base.html`
- CSRF-protected Fetch forms, JSON responses `{success|status, message}`
- Toast/notification helpers via `showNotification()`

### 8. Environment and Configuration

- **.env keys**: `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ANNUAL_SUBSCRIPTION_FEE`, `FINE_PER_DAY`
- **Storage/Media**: S3 via `django-storages` when configured
- **Settings module**: `library_system.settings`

### 9. Install/Run (Windows PowerShell)

- **One-time setup:**

  ```powershell
  ./setup.ps1
  ```

- **Development:**

  ```powershell
  ./run.ps1 dev
  ```

- **Production (example):**

  ```powershell
  ./run.ps1
  ```

- Both scripts auto-activate `.\venv` when present

### 10. Operational Behavior

- Single logout alert enforced by clearing message storage before redirect
- Staff dashboards show user management UI; server-side checks enforce restrictions
- Legacy URLs retained for backward compatibility under `/users/`

### 11. Testing Expectations

- Root-level `test_*.py` helpers for view checks and debugging
- Basic smoke tests for login flow, system settings page, and redirects
- Manual checks:
  - Admin CRUD all users
  - Staff CRUD students/lecturers only; view-only for admin/staff
  - Edit user (username/email uniqueness, password change with session preserved if self)
  - Logout shows one success message

### 12. Acceptance Criteria

- Role enforcement exactly as specified for Admin/Staff/Lecturer/Student
- All user CRUD paths function with server-side validation
- Subscription gating works: lecturers bypass purchase; students require active subscription
- venv-first scripts reliably start app from a clean machine
- Single logout message observed consistently

### 13. Non-Goals

- External SSO/OAuth beyond configured allauth defaults
- Complex reporting/analytics beyond current dashboards

### 14. Future Enhancements

- Bulk user operations with role-respecting guards
- Audit trail for user management actions
- Notification preferences and delivery channels
