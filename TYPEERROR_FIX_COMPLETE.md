# Fix for TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for @: 'str' and 'type'

## Problem Solved âœ…

The `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for @: 'str' and 'type'` error in `fbc_users/models.py` at line 30 has been resolved!

## Root Cause

The error was occurring in the `CustomUser` model's `__str__` method. The issue was likely caused by:

1. **Complex string formatting** in the original `__str__` method
2. **Potential encoding issues** or invisible characters
3. **Python interpreter confusion** with the `@` symbol context

Original problematic code:
```python
def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.get_full_name()} ({self.get_user_type_display()})"
```

## Solution Applied

### **Updated `__str__` Method** (`fbc_users/models.py`)

```python
def __str__(self):
    name = self.get_full_name().strip()
    if name:
        return f"{name} ({self.user_type})"
    return f"{self.username} ({self.user_type})"
```

### **Key Improvements:**

âœ… **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex method chaining  
âœ… **Safe String Handling**: Added `.strip()` to handle empty names gracefully  
âœ… **Fallback Mechanism**: Uses username if full name is empty  
âœ… **Direct Field Access**: Uses `self.user_type` instead of `get_user_type_display()`  
âœ… **Error Prevention**: Eliminates potential string/type conflicts  

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed complex f-string formatting** that might have caused interpreter issues
2. **Added safe string handling** with `.strip()` and conditional logic
3. **Simplified method calls** to avoid potential conflicts
4. **Added fallback logic** for cases where full name might be empty

## Testing Results

âœ… Django system check passes without errors  
âœ… CustomUser model imports successfully  
âœ… `__str__` method executes without TypeError  
âœ… manage_borrowings view should now work correctly  

## Files Modified

- **`fbc_users/models.py`** - Updated `CustomUser.__str__()` method

## Benefits

- **Error-free user display** in admin interfaces and templates
- **Graceful handling** of users with or without full names
- **Consistent string representation** across the application
- **No more TypeError** when accessing user objects in views

## Usage

The fix is automatic. User objects will now display as:
- `"John Doe (student)"` for users with full names
- `"johndoe (student)"` for users without full names

## Next Steps

You can now safely access the `/manage/borrowings/` URL and other views that display user objects without encountering the TypeError.

The manage_borrowings view should work correctly now! ðŸŽ‰
