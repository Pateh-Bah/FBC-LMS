# System Testing and Evaluation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing and evaluation process for the FBC Library Management System. The goal is to ensure that the system meets functional, performance, and usability requirements.

---

## Testing Objectives
1. Verify that all system features function as intended.
2. Identify and resolve any bugs or issues.
3. Ensure the system meets performance benchmarks.
4. Validate the user interface for usability and accessibility.

## Testing Phases

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Objective**: Test individual components and functions.
- **Tools**: Django Test Framework, Pytest.
- **Scope**:
  - Models: Validate data integrity and constraints.
  - Views: Ensure correct HTTP responses.
  - Forms: Verify validation rules.

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Objective**: Test interactions between system components.
- **Tools**: Postman, Selenium.
- **Scope**:
  - User authentication and role-based access.
  - Payment processing workflows.
  - Notifications and alerts.

### 3. System Testing
- **Objective**: Test the entire system as a whole.
- **Tools**: Selenium, BrowserStack.
- **Scope**:
  - End-to-end workflows (e.g., borrowing a book, paying fines).
  - Compatibility across browsers and devices.

### 4. Performance Testing
- **Objective**: Measure system performance under load.
- **Tools**: Apache JMeter, Locust.
- **Scope**:
  - Response time for key operations.
  - System behavior under concurrent user load.

### 5. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Objective**: Validate the system with real users.
- **Participants**: Admins, staff, lecturers, students.
- **Scope**:
  - Usability testing.
  - Feedback collection and iteration.

- **Description**: Verify that users can log in with valid credentials.
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the login page.
  2. Enter valid username and password.
  3. Click the "Login" button.
- **Expected Result**: User is redirected to the appropriate dashboard.

### Example Test Case: Add Fine
- **Test ID**: TC002
- **Description**: Verify that admins can add fines.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an admin.
  2. Navigate to the "Manage Fines" page.
  3. Click "Add Fine" and fill out the form.
  4. Submit the form.
- **Expected Result**: Fine is added and displayed in the fines table.
