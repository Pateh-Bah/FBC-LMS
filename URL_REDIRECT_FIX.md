# URL Redirect Fix for Old Admin URLs

## Problem
Users were getting 404 errors when accessing old admin URLs like `/admin/manage-books/`, `/admin/manage-users/`, etc. These URLs were changed to avoid conflicts with Django's admin system, but users may have bookmarks or cached links to the old URLs.

## Solution
Added redirect views in the main URLconf (`library_system/urls.py`) to catch the old admin URLs and redirect them to the new locations before they reach Django's admin catch-all pattern.

## Implementation

### Added to `library_system/urls.py`:

```python
from django.shortcuts import redirect

# Redirect views for old admin URLs
def redirect_old_admin_dashboard(request):
    return redirect('fbc_books:admin_dashboard', permanent=True)

def redirect_old_manage_books(request):
    return redirect('fbc_books:manage_books', permanent=True)
    
def redirect_old_manage_users(request):
    return redirect('fbc_books:manage_users', permanent=True)
    
def redirect_old_manage_borrowings(request):
    return redirect('fbc_books:manage_borrowings', permanent=True)

urlpatterns = [
    # Redirects for old admin URLs (must come before admin/ to catch them)
    path('admin/dashboard/', redirect_old_admin_dashboard),
    path('admin/manage-books/', redirect_old_manage_books),
    path('admin/manage-users/', redirect_old_manage_users),
    path('admin/manage-borrowings/', redirect_old_manage_borrowings),
    
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # ... rest of URLs
]
```

## URL Mapping

| Old URL | New URL | Redirect Status |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `/admin/dashboard/` | `/dashboard/admin/` | 301 (Permanent) |
| `/admin/manage-books/` | `/manage/books/` | 301 (Permanent) |
| `/admin/manage-users/` | `/manage/users/` | 301 (Permanent) |
| `/admin/manage-borrowings/` | `/manage/borrowings/` | 301 (Permanent) |

## Why This Works
1. **URL Pattern Order**: The redirect patterns are placed before `path('admin/', admin.site.urls)` in the URLconf
2. **Pattern Matching**: Django matches URLs in order, so our specific patterns are matched before the Django admin catch-all
3. **Permanent Redirects**: Using 301 redirects tells browsers and search engines that the URLs have permanently moved
4. **Named URL Usage**: The redirects use Django's named URLs, so they automatically adapt if we change the target URLs again

## Testing
- ✅ `/admin/manage-books/` → redirects to `/manage/books/`
- ✅ `/admin/manage-users/` → redirects to `/manage/users/`
- ✅ `/admin/manage-borrowings/` → redirects to `/manage/borrowings/`
- ✅ `/admin/dashboard/` → redirects to `/dashboard/admin/`
- ✅ `/admin/` → still works for Django admin

## Benefits
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Old bookmarks and links continue to work
2. **SEO Friendly**: 301 redirects maintain search engine rankings
3. **User Experience**: No broken links or 404 errors
4. **Clean Migration**: Gradual transition from old to new URLs
5. **Maintenance**: Easy to remove redirects later when old URLs are no longer used

## Files Modified
- `library_system/urls.py` - Added redirect views and URL patterns

This fix ensures that users accessing old admin URLs are automatically redirected to the correct new locations, preventing 404 errors and maintaining a smooth user experience.
