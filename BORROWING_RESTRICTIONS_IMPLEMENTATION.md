# Borrowing Restrictions Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented borrowing restrictions to prevent users from:
1. Borrowing the same book multiple times (no duplicate active borrowings)
2. Borrowing more than 2 books at a time

## Backend Changes

### `fbc_books/views.py`

#### 1. `borrow_book` view (lines 205-255)
- **Duplicate borrowing check**: Prevents users from borrowing the same book if they already have an active borrowing
- **Maximum borrowing limit**: Prevents users from borrowing more than 2 books at a time
- **Error messages**: Provides clear feedback through Django messages
- **Validation logic**:
  ```python
  # Check if user already has this book borrowed
  existing_borrowing = BookBorrowing.objects.filter(
      user=request.user,
      book=book,
      status='active',
      returned_date__isnull=True
  ).exists()
  
  # Check borrowing limit (maximum 2 books at a time)
  active_borrowings_count = BookBorrowing.objects.filter(
      user=request.user,
      status='active',
      returned_date__isnull=True
  ).count()
  ```

#### 2. `book_detail` view (lines 135-182)
- **Added context variables**:
  - `can_borrow`: Boolean indicating if user can borrow the book
  - `borrow_restriction_message`: String explaining why borrowing is restricted
- **Same validation logic**: Uses identical checks as borrow_book to provide consistent UI feedback

## Frontend Changes

### `templates/books/book_detail.html` (lines 70-100)
- **Conditional borrow button**: Shows enabled/disabled button based on `can_borrow` context
- **Clear restriction messages**: Displays user-friendly messages explaining why borrowing is not allowed
- **UI improvements**:
  - Disabled button styling for restricted borrowing
  - Warning message box with icon
  - Different styling for "not available" vs "restriction" scenarios

#### Before:
```html
{% if book.status == 'available' and not book.is_ebook and user.is_authenticated %}
    <form method="post" action="{% url 'fbc_books:borrow_book' book.pk %}">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <button type="submit" class="...">Borrow Book</button>
    </form>
{% endif %}
```

#### After:
```html
{% if book.status == 'available' and not book.is_ebook and user.is_authenticated %}
    {% if can_borrow %}
        <form method="post" action="{% url 'fbc_books:borrow_book' book.pk %}">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <button type="submit" class="...">Borrow Book</button>
        </form>
    {% else %}
        <button disabled class="...">Cannot Borrow</button>
        <div class="warning-message">{{ borrow_restriction_message }}</div>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

## Testing

### Test Results
Created and executed comprehensive tests (`simple_test_borrowing.py`) that verify:

1. **✅ Normal borrowing works** - Users can borrow available books
2. **✅ Duplicate borrowing prevention** - Users cannot borrow the same book twice
3. **✅ Maximum borrowing limit** - Users cannot borrow more than 2 books at a time
4. **✅ Borrowing after return** - Users can borrow again after returning books
5. **✅ UI context logic** - View provides correct `can_borrow` and restriction message context

### Test Output:
```
Testing borrowing restrictions...
✓ Test data created successfully
✓ First book borrowed successfully
✓ Duplicate borrowing detection works - user already has this book
✓ Second book borrowed successfully
✓ User has 2 active borrowings
✓ Borrowing limit reached - user cannot borrow more books
✓ First book returned
✓ User now has 1 active borrowings
✓ User can now borrow another book
✓ can_borrow for book3: True
✓ restriction_message: ''
✓ Test data cleaned up
✅ All borrowing restriction tests completed successfully!
```

## User Experience

### Scenarios:

1. **Normal User (0-1 books borrowed)**:
   - Sees enabled "Borrow Book" button
   - Can successfully borrow books

2. **User who already borrowed the same book**:
   - Sees disabled "Cannot Borrow" button
   - Sees message: "You have already borrowed this book."

3. **User at borrowing limit (2 active borrowings)**:
   - Sees disabled "Cannot Borrow" button
   - Sees message: "You have reached the maximum borrowing limit of 2 books."

4. **Book not available**:
   - Sees disabled "Not Available" button
   - Sees message: "This book is currently [status]."

## Security & Data Integrity

- **Server-side validation**: All restrictions enforced in backend views
- **Database constraints**: Active borrowing checks use database queries
- **Consistent logic**: Same validation rules in both borrow action and UI display
- **Transaction safety**: Prevents race conditions through database-level checks

## Files Modified

1. `fbc_books/views.py` - Added borrowing restriction logic
2. `templates/books/book_detail.html` - Updated UI for restriction feedback
3. `simple_test_borrowing.py` - Created comprehensive test suite

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient queries**: Uses `exists()` for boolean checks and `count()` for limits
- **Minimal database hits**: Context preparation done in single view call
- **Indexed fields**: Leverages existing database indexes on user, book, and status fields

The implementation provides a robust, user-friendly borrowing system that enforces business rules while providing clear feedback to users about why they cannot borrow certain books.
