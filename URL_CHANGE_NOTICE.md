# URL Change Notice - Admin Management URLs

## ⚠️ URL Update Required

The admin management URLs have been updated to avoid conflicts with Django's built-in admin system.

### Old URLs (No Longer Work)
- ❌ `/admin/dashboard/`
- ❌ `/admin/manage-books/`
- ❌ `/admin/manage-users/`
- ❌ `/admin/manage-borrowings/`

### New URLs (Current)
- ✅ `/dashboard/admin/`
- ✅ `/manage/books/`
- ✅ `/manage/users/`
- ✅ `/manage/borrowings/`

## Quick Access Links

If you're getting a 404 error, please use these updated URLs:

### Admin Dashboard
**New URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/admin/`

### Book Management
**New URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/manage/books/`

### User Management
**New URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/manage/users/`

### Borrowing Management
**New URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/manage/borrowings/`

## How to Update Your Bookmarks

1. **Delete old bookmarks** pointing to `/admin/manage-*` URLs
2. **Add new bookmarks** using the URLs above
3. **Use the navigation menu** in the application instead of direct URLs

## Why The Change?

The old URLs starting with `/admin/` were conflicting with Django's built-in admin system at `/admin/`. To resolve this conflict and provide a better user experience, we moved the custom admin features to new URL paths.

## Navigation Tip

Instead of typing URLs directly, use the navigation menu after logging in:
1. Login at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/login/`
2. Use the dashboard navigation links
3. All links in the application have been updated to use the new URLs

The Django admin (`/admin/`) still works normally for database administration.
