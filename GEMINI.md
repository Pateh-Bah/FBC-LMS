## Unified Sidebar and Top Navigation

**Goal:** Unify the sidebar and top navigation for all user roles to match the admin's sidebar design, while respecting the constraints of each user role.

**Plan:**

1.  **Analyze existing templates:**
    *   `templates/admin/admin_base.html`: Main admin dashboard base template.
    *   `templates/admin/staff_base.html`: Staff dashboard base template, extends `admin_base.html`.
    *   `templates/dashboard/user_dashboard.html`: Student and lecturer dashboard.
    *   `templates/admin/includes/sidebar.html`: The common sidebar include.
    *   `templates/admin/includes/top_nav.html`: The common top navigation include.

2.  **Create a new base template:**
    *   Create `templates/dashboard/user_base.html` for students and lecturers.

3.  **Modify `user_base.html`:**
    *   Copy the content of `templates/admin/admin_base.html` into `templates/dashboard/user_base.html`.
    *   Ensure the sidebar is included using `{% include 'admin/includes/sidebar.html' %}`.
    *   Ensure the top navigation is included using `{% include 'admin/includes/top_nav.html' %}`.

4.  **Update `user_dashboard.html`:**
    *   Change `{% extends 'dashboard/base_dashboard.html' %}` to `{% extends 'dashboard/user_base.html' %}`.

5.  **Update `profile.html`:**
    *   Change `{% extends 'base.html' %}` to `{% extends 'dashboard/user_base.html' %}`.

6.  **Update `my_books.html`:**
    *   Change `{% extends 'base.html' %}` to `{% extends 'dashboard/user_base.html' %}`.

7.  **Fix Sidebar Links:**
    *   Correct the "My Borrowings" link in `admin/includes/sidebar.html` to point to the correct URL.
    *   Verify all other links in the sidebar for all user roles.

8.  **Fix Dashboard Link on Home Page:**
    *   Correct the dashboard link in `templates/base.html` to redirect to the appropriate dashboard based on the user's role.

9.  **Enhance "My Books" Page UI:**
    *   Restructure the layout of `books/my_books.html`.
    *   Apply modern styling to the cards and tables.
    *   Improve the empty state message.

10. **Fix Blank Subscription Page:**
    *   Add content to the `users/my_subscription.html` template.
    *   Ensure the template extends the `dashboard/user_base.html` template.

11. **Implement Subscription Renewal Payment Options:**
    *   Create a new view and template for the subscription renewal page (`renew_subscription.html`).
    *   Add a payment form with options for Mobile Money (Orange Money, AfriMoney, QMoney) and PayPal/Credit Card.
    *   Implement JavaScript to show/hide relevant input fields based on the selected payment method.
    *   Modify the `process_subscription_payment` view to handle payment details for both Mobile Money (phone number, password) and PayPal/Credit Card (card number, expiry, CVC).
    *   **Security Note:** Emphasized that raw credit card details are not stored; only last four digits and a simulated token are kept for reference.

12. **Add "My Fines" Page and Payment:**
    *   Add a "My Fines" link to the sidebar for students and lecturers in `admin/includes/sidebar.html`.
    *   Create a `my_fines` view in `fbc_fines/views.py` to retrieve and display the user's fines.
    *   Create a `my_fines.html` template to display the fines and integrate payment options (reusing the payment modal logic).
    *   Add a `process_fine_payment` view in `fbc_fines/views.py` to handle fine payments, update fine status, and record payments.
    *   Ensure the UI of the "My Fines" page is consistent with other enhanced pages.
    *   Ensure the fine amount is automatically determined and passed to the payment process.

13. **Fix "My Subscription" Page UI Consistency:**
    *   Re-verified `users/my_subscription.html` to ensure it correctly extends `dashboard/user_base.html` and uses consistent Tailwind CSS styling.
    *   Performed a minor, non-functional change to the template to force a refresh and resolve potential caching issues.

14. **Re-verify "My Fines" Page UI Consistency and Payment Flow:**
    *   Re-examined `fbc_fines/my_fines.html` to confirm it extends `dashboard/user_base.html` and uses consistent styling.
    *   Confirmed that the "Pay Fine" button correctly triggers the payment modal and automatically passes the fine amount.
    *   Performed a minor, non-functional change to the template to force a refresh and resolve potential caching issues.
