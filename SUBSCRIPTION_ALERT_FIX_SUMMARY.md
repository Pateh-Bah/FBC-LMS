# Subscription Alert Fix - Summary

## Problem
Lecturers (and potentially staff/admin) were seeing subscription expired alerts on their dashboard:
> "Subscription Expired - Your library subscription has expired. You won't be able to borrow books until you renew your subscription. Please visit the library desk to renew your subscription for the current academic year."

This message should only be visible to students with expired subscriptions.

## Root Cause
The subscription alert templates were not properly checking user types:
1. `templates/books/user_dashboard.html` - Only checked `{% if not user.is_subscription_active %}` without user type validation
2. `templates/dashboard/user_dashboard.html` - Used `{% if not user.user_type == 'lecturer' %}` which still allowed staff and admin to see alerts

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Main Subscription Alert (`templates/books/user_dashboard.html`)
**Before:**
```django
{% if not user.is_subscription_active %}
```

**After:**
```django
{% if user.user_type == 'student' and not user.is_subscription_active %}
```

### 2. Fixed Subscription Status Badge (`templates/dashboard/user_dashboard.html`)
**Before:**
```django
{% if not user.user_type == 'lecturer' and user.subscription_end_date %}
```

**After:**
```django
{% if user.user_type == 'student' and user.subscription_end_date %}
```

### 3. Templates Already Correctly Configured
- ✅ `templates/dashboard/user_dashboard_base.html` - Already has `{% if user.user_type == 'student' %}`
- ✅ `templates/users/student_dashboard.html` - Template is student-specific by design

## Result
- ✅ **Students**: See subscription alerts and status only when relevant
- ✅ **Lecturers**: No longer see irrelevant subscription alerts
- ✅ **Staff**: No longer see irrelevant subscription alerts  
- ✅ **Admin**: No longer see irrelevant subscription alerts

## Files Modified
1. `templates/books/user_dashboard.html` - Added student user type check to main alert
2. `templates/dashboard/user_dashboard.html` - Restricted subscription badge to students only

## Verification
The subscription alert system now properly restricts all subscription-related messages and badges to students only, ensuring that lecturers, staff, and admin users don't see irrelevant subscription information on their dashboards.

## Impact
- Improved user experience for non-student users
- More logical information display based on user roles
- Maintains subscription functionality for students while removing confusion for other user types
